      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wondered to yourself, “Where did I go wrong?” “Why won’t anyone hire me?” If you have, you are not alone. Imagine having an entire website dedicated to the wonderful things you’ve accomplished. Think of how much farther that could get you than the competition. I have just that. An entire webpage that everyone can see, all about you. What job won’t you be able to get? That is what this website can do for you.</p>  <!-- change this -->
